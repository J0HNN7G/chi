# chi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/J0HNN7G/chi.svg?token=ZvK25wQRVaBqu1vwJ2pP&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/J0HNN7G/chi)

 Chi is functional programming language I am making to study functional programming language design and the Curry-Howard isomorphism.

 ### TODO

 - [x] The Core language
 - [ ] Template instantiation
 - [ ] The G-machine
 - [ ] Lambda Lifting
 - [ ] Type to theorem function (optional)
 - [ ] Step-by-step evaluation (optional)

 ### References

The following are resources I have used to implement Chi.

1.  Peyton Jones, Simon L., and David R. Lester. "*Implementing Functional Languages: a Tutorial*". Prentice Hall, 1992, Microsoft, www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/implementing-functional-languages-a-tutorial/.
    - This is the main literature I am using as guidance for implementing Chi; I aim to cover chapters 1-3 and 6. For anyone wanting to implement a functional programming       language with no prior experience, I cannot recommend this book enough.

2.  Diehl, Stephen. Write You a Haskell. 2016, dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/.
    - This is a blog series on writing functional programming language. The series provides an up-to-date approach to writing a functional programming language. It can be quite    lacking in explanations, but it provides very elegant solutions to certain aspects of language design, e.g., monadic parsers.
